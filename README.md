# summer-project

The aim of my project is to document the process for integrating the network traffic analyser Zeek with a software defined network controller (Like Ryu). By doing this, we can detect suspicious traffic and then quarantine malicious hosts.

Right now you can run a ryu learning switch with a simple mininet network of 3 hosts and a switch with run.sh
